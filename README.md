# Dropout Prediction Model

This project leverages machine learning to predict student dropout risk using demographic and educational indicators from the Florida Department of Education. It uses an XGBoost classifier and features a web-based frontend for interaction.

---

## Features

- Predicts dropout risk based on:
  - At-Risk flag
  - Economic Disadvantage
  - ELL status
  - Homelessness
  - Gender
  - Disability
  - Race
- Probability output for interpretation
- Web-based UI using HTML/CSS/JS
- Flask API endpoint (`/predict`) for real-time predictions

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dropout-predictor.git
cd dropout-predictor
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and Flask:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

### 4. Open the Frontend

Open `dropout.html` in your browser and use the form to submit predictions.

##  API Endpoint

**POST** `/predict`

* **Input JSON:**

```json
{
  "At Risk": 1,
  "Economically Disadvantage": 1,
  "English Language Learner": 0,
  "Homeless Student IND": 0,
  "Gender": 1,
  "Student With Disablity": 0,
  "Race": 2
}
```

* **Response:**

```json
{
  "prediction": 1,
  "dropout_probability": 0.82
}
```

---

## Model Performance

* **F1 Score**: 0.711
* **AUC**: 0.631
* Trained using `XGBoostClassifier` with SMOTE sampling and SHAP interpretability

---

## Interpretable AI

SHAP plots are used to visualize the contribution of each feature to individual and global model decisions.

---

## Notes

* For deployment to production, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI
* Do not expose personally identifiable data
* Future work includes longitudinal tracking and fairness auditing
